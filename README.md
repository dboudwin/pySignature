This project isn't maintained and hasn't been updated in years. I don't work on Windows desktops anymore. Anyone who would like, feel free to take it over.

pySignature
===========

Unify your company's Outlook email signatures with a dynamic signature generator!

I wrote this to replace the Exchange transport rule we had been using for signatures. This differs from the transport rule method because
these signatures appear at the end of the most recent post right where they should, instead of at the bottom of the email chain.

Using Tim Golden's excellent active_directory module (http://timgolden.me.uk/python/active_directory.html) pySignature
pulls data from Active Directory and using Jinja2 templates, creates HTML, RTF, and TXT Outlook signatures for 2003, 2007, 2010,
and 2013.

The script is designed to be run as a logon script in the netlogon folder. It will generate the signatures and edit the registry
to automatically enforce them for the current profile. When run as a logon script the signatures will auto-update with any new
information.

Editing the templates is a simple process except for the richtext one. You'll need a little trial and error to get that one perfect.

I've tested it on XP and 7, hopefully it won't break anything.

Deployment
===========

This can be compiled very easily into an .exe file using the pyinstaller module. Alternatively portable python can be installed in a
network location to run the script.

Requires Tim Golden's active_directory module, Mark Hammond's pywin32 module, and jinja2.
Requires python 2.7, not tested with 3.

Outlook and HTML
===========

Outlook can't handle a lot of modern HTML techniques, it depends a lot on tables. Test new HTML heavily in Outlook before rolling out.
